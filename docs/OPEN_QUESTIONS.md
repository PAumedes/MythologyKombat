# OPEN QUESTIONS

## Repo setup (from T0.1)

| # | Question | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | What git user name should commits use? | No git user identity is set on this machine. The first commit used a per-command author. The user is to choose the name. |
| 2 | Should `.claude/settings.json` also deny `Write` to `ps1_game/**`? | The current deny rule covers `Edit(ps1_game/**)` only. Reviewer suggestion. |
| 3 | Should `.gitignore` stop ignoring `*.exe` and `*.dll` everywhere? | A global ignore could hide legitimate tool binaries added later. Reviewer suggestion. |

## Prerequisite check (from T0.2)

| # | Question | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 4 | Should the 15 s timeout also cover a hung tool? | The script calls `ReadToEnd` before `WaitForExit`. So the timeout does not stop a tool that hangs. Reviewer note. |
| 5 | Should the Java version show more than major.minor? | The script shows Java as major.minor only. Reviewer note. |
| 6 | Should the messages say "22.0+" instead of "need 22.0"? | The messages say "need 22.0" without the "+". The required version is 22+. Reviewer note. |
| 7 | Do the Ghidra, emulator, gcc and clang checks work when the tool is installed? | The found case has not been tested for these four tools. Reviewer note. |
