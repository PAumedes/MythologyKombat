# OPEN QUESTIONS

## Repo setup (from T0.1)

| # | Question | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 1 | What git user name should commits use? | No git user identity is set on this machine. The first commit used a per-command author. The user is to choose the name. |
| 2 | Should `.claude/settings.json` also deny `Write` to `ps1_game/**`? | The current deny rule covers `Edit(ps1_game/**)` only. Reviewer suggestion. |
| 3 | Should `.gitignore` stop ignoring `*.exe` and `*.dll` everywhere? | A global ignore could hide legitimate tool binaries added later. Reviewer suggestion. |

## Prerequisite check (from T0.2)

| # | Question | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 4 | Should the 15 s timeout also cover a hung tool? | The script calls `ReadToEnd` before `WaitForExit`. So the timeout does not stop a tool that hangs. Reviewer note. |
| 5 | Should the Java version show more than major.minor? | The script shows Java as major.minor only. Reviewer note. |
| 6 | Should the messages say "22.0+" instead of "need 22.0"? | The messages say "need 22.0" without the "+". The required version is 22+. Reviewer note. |
| 7 | Do the Ghidra, emulator, gcc and clang checks work when the tool is installed? | The found case has not been tested for these four tools. Reviewer note. |

## Disc identity (from T0.4)

| # | Question | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 8 | Does the sector count use the first track's sector size? | `tools\disc_identify.py` counts sectors with the first track's size. The disc has one track, so this is fine here. Reviewer note. |
| 9 | Is the serial regex search-based or anchored? | The serial match searches the `BOOT=` line. It is not anchored. Reviewer note. |
| 10 | What does the script say when the `.wav` audio file is missing? | The message mentions ".bin" when a `.wav` file is missing. Reviewer note. |
| 11 | Does the script handle multi-FILE cues and INDEX 00? | Only synthetic cues were tested. The real disc has one FILE and one track. Reviewer note. |

## PSXRecomp framework (from T0.5)

| # | Question | Notes |
|---|----------|-------|
| 12 | Why does the default `cmake --build recompiler/build` fail? | Two upstream test targets, `ws_cull_edge_interp_test` and `draw_distance_interp_test`, fail to link. The linker reports undefined symbols such as `gr_backend`. Built with `-O3 -flto` on clang 22. Reviewer reproduced it. Not checked whether upstream CI builds these targets with this toolchain. The workaround is to build explicit targets. |
| 13 | Should the submodule ignore CRLF noise? | `git status` shows `psxrecomp` as modified because of `core.autocrlf=true` on the tracked generated `OpenBIOS*` files. Possible fixes: `git config submodule.psxrecomp.ignore dirty`, or set `core.autocrlf` to false inside the submodule. Not applied. |
| 14 | Should the Vulkan SDK be installed? | The Vulkan SDK is absent, so the Vulkan renderer is a software stub. Not decided. |
| 15 | Should `psx-beetle` be built? | The target was skipped because `libmednafen_psx.a` is absent. Not decided. |
| 16 | What causes the `DEFAULT_BIOS_PATH` warning in `psx-oracle`? | The build prints the warning. The cause and effect are not checked. |
| 17 | Should the `.gitmodules` and gitlink commit be fixed? | `.gitmodules` and the `psxrecomp` gitlink were committed in the "T0.7" commit `beee35b` by accident of staging order. Not decided whether to rewrite history. |
